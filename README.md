John Marinuzzi discussed his software architect career at boeing.
## Background
He first started off talking about his background and education. He started off being a software engineer and moved to management and eventaully to software architecture

## Work
He is currently working on a P-8 accousitc system to help with missions and flights. He has worked on Microservice Architectures which is a large software product vuild as a suite of well defined and encapsulated components and services with loose coupling and well defined interfaces. He also talked about his work with containers and the advantages of leveraging the docker file. He has worked with Databus abstraction to provide a layer between the application code and specific middleware. He also talked about his operator pattern and how he uses Kubernetes operators to extend the Kubernetes API. He went over his architecture overviews and the different parts to building a program. he then continued to talk about the importances of the software development environment. 

## My takeaway 
Learning about John Marinuzzi's career path was interesting to me as I plan to work in the industry software engineering. It was cool to hear his path from Engineer-> Manager -> Architect. I wasn't aware of how important microservices were when he was explaining it in his line of work. It was cool for him to say how important containerization is in his line of work since I work with them every day in my other computer science courses. In conclusion, It was interesting to learn about how software engineering leverages the tools at their disposal and use it for their benefit.  When he talked about his days working at the space shuttle, I couldn't help but seen the vast variety of places you can work as a software engineer.
